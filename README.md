# StructFDR
False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control Procedure Integrating the Prior Structure Information. The package is designed to perform more powerful false discovery control (FDR) for microbiome data, taking into account the prior phylogenetic relationship among bacteria species.  As a general methodology, it is applicable to any type of (genomic) data with prior structure information, as long as a distance metric between features are defined.
